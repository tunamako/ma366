The goal of this paper is to provide a concise introduction to low-dimensional manifolds and their properties, including smoothness, atlases, and differentials.  There will primarily be a focus on 2-manifolds with some 3-manifolds as well, albeit more briefly and with slightly less rigor.

The text on manifolds by Tu is considered to be the standard for introductory topics in this field and will be used for most of the information in the paper. The second text by Thurston is a clear choice when it comes to 3-manifolds as he pioneered a much of the field and provides some wonderful insight on the topic.
